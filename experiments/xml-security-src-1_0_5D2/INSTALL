Subject: Announcement: Apache XML Security v1.0.0

XML Security v1.0.0 Released
---------------------
  We are proud to announce the 1.0.0 final
  release of the XML Security package.

About XML Security
------------------
  The XML Security project is an implementation of
  security related XML standards. Currently, it includes
  implementations of W3C recommendations "Canonical XML"
  and "XML Signature Syntax and Processing".

  Basically, this means that you can use this software
  for creating and verifying digital signatures which
  are expressed in XML and sign both XML and/or arbitrary
  contents.

For more information about the XML Security project, please go to
http://xml.apache.org/security/

For more information about XML Signature, go to
http://www.w3.org/Signature/

For pointers about XML Security in general, please go to
http://www.nue.et-inf.uni-siegen.de/~geuer-pollmann/xml_security.html

---------------------------------------------------------

Downloads for XML Security v1.0.0 are available at
http://xml.apache.org/security/dist/

The source distibution is available at
http://xml.apache.org/security/dist/xml-security-src-1_0_0.zip (1.0 MB)
http://xml.apache.org/security/dist/xml-security-src-1_0_0.zip.sig

The binary distibution is available at
http://xml.apache.org/security/dist/xml-security-bin-1_0_0.zip (3.1 MB)
http://xml.apache.org/security/dist/xml-security-bin-1_0_0.zip.sig

---------------------------------------------------------

The source distibution includes
 - JAVA source code for the library itself
 - JAVA unit test code for the library
 - JAVA sample code for the library
 - test vectors for the unit tests

The source distibution does _not_ include
 - JavaDocs
 - the required (binary JAR) libraries.
   The libraries are available under http://xml.apache.org/ .
   It requires
   - Jakarta ANT as build/make tool
     http://jakarta.apache.org/builds/jakarta-ant/release/v1.4.1/bin/jakarta-ant
-1.4.1-bin.zip
   - Apache Xerces v2.0.0
     http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/Xerces-J-bin.2.0.0.zip
   - Apache Xalan v2.2.0
     http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/xalan-j_2_2-bin.zip
   - Jakarta Log4J
     http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/jakarta-log4j-1.2beta2.zip
   - JUnit 3.7
     http://download.sourceforge.net/junit/junit3.7.zip
   - A JCE Cryptographic Service Provider.
     The distibution uses the BounceCastle JCE as a default provider.
     When you first start ant for compiling, the JCE JAR is downloaded
     from http://www.bouncycastle.org/ . This hook is included to
     circumvent US export restrictions.

---------------------------------------------------------

The binary distibution includes
 - JAVA sample code for the library
 - test vectors for the unit tests
 - Generated JavaDocs
 - The complete library compiled
 - All required libaries (but not the JCE which is downloaded online).

---------------------------------------------------------

Download of the JCE

The ant make tools initiates an automated download of the BouncyCastle JCE. 
The file is downloaded into the libs/ directory and a "bc-" is prepended 
to the filename. This is done because we want the provider name (bc means 
BouncyCastle) being visible in the JAR's filename. 

If you are a little paranoid like all security people and don't want ant to 
make automated downloads or your firewall doesn't permit it, look in the 
./build.xml file for the properties called

<property 
     name="jce.download.file" 
     value="jce-jdk13-112.jar" />
<property 
     name="jce.download" 
     value="http://www.bouncycastle.org/download/${jce.download.file}" />
<property 
     name="lib.jce"      
     value="${libs}/bc-${jce.download.file}" />

Here you can see that the file 

http://www.bouncycastle.org/download/jce-jdk13-112.jar

is downloaded and stored in the location 

libs/bc-jce-jdk13-112.jar

If you do this by hand (pointing you favourite web browser and download it 
yourself), simply put a "bc-" in front of the filename and put it to ./libs/, 
then ant won't try to make a download.
